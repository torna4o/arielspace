Codes for Ariel Space Mission data analysis

This repository is for the expected Ariel Space Mission data analysis. The launch is planned in 2029, but of course, many people started to work for it to be successful years before. For instance, currently, we have an active Machine Learning Data Challenge that will end in June 18, 2023, sunday. If you would like to contribute to this great mission to characterize exoplanet atmospheres, the time is now!

## ADC2023_base_mod.ipynb

This code is only slightly different than the baseline solution available in the Data Challenge website. It's raison d'Ã©tre is being able to use Google Colab to retrieve required files, construct ML models, and create submissions for the data challenge. Depending on your current assets for machine learning, it can have numerous advantages. One of them is free GPU, TPU utilization chance.
